  "description": "AES4ALL is a SNK Neo Geo AES and MVS emulator. NOTE: To use AES4ALL (NEO4ALL/AES), you need to convert typical ZIP-compressed NEOGEO roms. The 'convertneo' command-line tool allows this conversion of supported games. First, put all files of NEOGEO bios (uncompress neogeo.zip of MAME) and 'aes-bios.bin' file of NEOGEO home to bios directory. Then, go to Windows CMD and execute 'convertneo.exe' with filename of ZIP as parameter, for example: C:\\temp\\convertneo> convertneo.exe migame.zip - If all are ok you will have a 'migame.aes' file for playing with AES4ALL.",
