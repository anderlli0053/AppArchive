  "description": "UltraHLE is an emulator allowing games for the Nintendo 64 game console to be run on a computer. It was hailed as a massive step forward in emulation technology upon its release in 1999. Emulating the N64 (which at the time was only 3 years old), it was the first of the N64 emulators to run commercial titles at a playable frame rate on the hardware of the time. Also notable for its time, UltraHLE was capable of playing commercial games while the console was still commercially viable.",
