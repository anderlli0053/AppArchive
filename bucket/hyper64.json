 "description": "Hyper64 is a working proof-of-concept of an experimental C64 emulator implementation without resorting to a conventional CPU emulation, but instead utilizing a realtime dynamic recompilation engine \u2013 which disassembles, analyzes and re-assembles the 6510 machine code as native 32-bit x86 code. It further uses a fast translation code cache.",
