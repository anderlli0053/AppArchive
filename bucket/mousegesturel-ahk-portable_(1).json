 "description": "MouseGestureL.ahk is a general-purpose mouse gesture software. Mouse gesture allows various window operations such as closing, minimizing, resizing, keystroke or clicking somewhere on the screen by the mouse movement like 'moving up cursor while holding down the right button' and 'left-click while holding down the right button'. It dramatically improves your work efficiency because you don't need aiming at small buttons and menu items to click them.",
