Everything regarding Scoop software can be found on [this](https://scoop.sh/) official page

### Scoop bucket for development tools, be it game dev or just regular software development, *and of course because i am not so well organized as it look like, there are also some games in here...*
<hr><hr>
Add this bucket after installing Scoop by typing:

```scoop bucket add anderlli0053_DEV-tools https://github.com/anderlli0053/DEV-tools.git```

Even faster way is ```scoop bucket add anderlli0053_DEV-tools https://github.com/anderlli0053/DEV-tools.git && scoop update && scoop install <anyAPPNameInTheBucket>```
<hr><hr>
Installing example:

* ```scoop install gdevelop```

or basically ```scoop install <anyAPPNameInTheBucket>```

For updating the bucket with the upstream use ```scoop update```, for other commands you can write ```scoop``` and press ENTER, it will output the list of available Scoop commands.
<hr>
Once the Scoop is successfully installed and in the System PATH, you can use whatever command-line you like, CMD, PowerShell,...


<hr>

___It started as a collection of manifests for development tools that i wrote, but then turned into a container of pretty much everything. Apps, Games, ... you name it!.___
<hr>

### THIS BUCKET CONTAINS [BOT]S THAT TAKE CARE OF IT, MEANING THEY UPDATE, LINT AND CHECK FOR OTHER MANIFEST ANOMALIES, ...! ###
